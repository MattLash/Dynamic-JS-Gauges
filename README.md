# Dynamic-JS-Gauges
Create Javascript based HTML gauges that dynamically resize based on window size.

Must create HTML5 canvas elements for the gauge to be located in.

Insert code into custom js file, call 'createGauge' with 3 arguments (gaugeID, score, color).
gaugeID = name of canvas element
score = number out of 100 that you want gauge to fill to
color = color of gauge fill

look for internal parameters if you need to make further changes or customizations.
if you need to change the background color of the gauge strip, change 'bgColor'
you can also change the canvas fill color, which is 'canvasColor'
